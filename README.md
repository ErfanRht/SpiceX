<h1 align="center">SpiceX: Modern Circuit Simulation</h1>
</p>

<p align="left">
SpiceX is an open-source electronic circuit simulator developed in C++ with the SDL2 library. Inspired by industry-standard software like LTspice and PSpice, SpiceX offers a powerful simulation engine with a modern, intuitive graphical user interface for a superior user experience.
</p>
<p align="left">
Designed as a final project for the Object-Oriented Programming course at Sharif University of Technology, SpiceX allows you to build, simulate, and analyze electronic circuits with ease. From simple DC analysis to complex transient and AC sweeps, SpiceX provides the tools you need to bring your circuit designs to life.
